# Question Answering Chatbot

This repository contains a small project on a question-answering chatbot without a UI. It demonstrates how to build and interact with a chatbot that can answer questions based on provided context.
The idea is to have a basis for building toy applications in future based on local and small language models.

It works on the langchain framework and traced with langsmith. The llm used is gpt-4o-mini that can be changed to any other model that is supported by langchain.
